## Hello there 👋

I'm Bradford (he/him), a fine-dining cook turned IT student. 

I’m looking for help with finding a tech internship, and open to anything from breaking down hardware for recycling, to configuring new machines, or anything else I haven't heard of yet.

As an experienced cook, a I'm quite failiar with critical and technical work following strict protocols, so it all feels like a great fit so far.

Some quick facts:
- 🔭 I’m working on my Associate's Degree in Computer Information Systems at WCC.
- 🌱 Currently I'm learning all the inner-workings of Cisco devices, and how to build and manage a network of any size.
- 👯 I’m always open to collaborate on any side project, or even a small business venture.
- 💬 I'm also always open to help you work on your billiards game, it's a whole magical world of minutae.
